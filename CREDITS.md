# Credits

While this was a passion project, I couldn't have done it all on my own. Several people need thanks for this project coming together. If I missed anyone, or if you do not want your work being used here, please let me know and I will be happy to fix it ASAP.


## Code

* Sanqui, Dannye for the [pokered-gen-II crysaudio](https://github.com/dannye/pokered-gen-II/tree/crysaudio) codebase that was used as a starting point.
* Myself (Luna) for the second region code, porting Gen II roof loading and tileset animations, jump ledges in other tilesets, berry trees, scripting the events, and everything else not listed here.


## Music

* TBD


## Graphics

* Gamefreak for sprites and tiles taken from Pokémon Red, Yellow, Gold, Crystal, and the SW97 Gold Demo.
* Tommo for the battle sprites for the female Rocket grunts, and Red.
* Kabocha for the Rei sprite.
* Myself (Luna) for editing the shading on a few Gen 2 battle sprites to better match the Gen 1/SW97 SGB aesthetic.
