# Pokémon RedGold & BlueSilver

In spite of its flaws, Gen 2 was (and still is) my favorite Pokémon generation. But, since I grew up in the 90s, that first adventure through Kanto still has a special nostalgic place in my heart too. While thinking back on those old adventures and various old romhacks from back in the day, I started to wonder what it would be like to reimagine Gen 2 in the style and feeling of Gen 1, and that thought grew into RedGold & BlueSilver. I know a hack like this probably won't appeal to everyone, and that's alright. But I hope the people that it does appeal to will enjoy it.
