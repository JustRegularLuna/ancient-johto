# Pokémon RedGold & BlueSilver

Put simply, this hack grew out of nostalgia. Gen 2 is still my favorite generation of Pokémon, while I still have a special nostalgic place in my heart for that first trip through Kanto back in the 90s. In addition to that, I was always fascinated by the beta Johto cities leftover inside the final games, and a lot of the new content from other various leaks that have occurred over the past few years.


This hack aims to combine the feeling of Gen 2, Gen 1, and aspects from multiple early stages of Gen 2's development into a new experience, using a lot of creative license to fill in the gaps and make it all work together. As such, this is not attempting to remake any one specific early build of the games, nor is it trying to faithfully demake Gen 2 onto the Gen 1 engine. It is a reimagined version of Gen 2 drawing from multiple inspirations to be its own thing.


I know this hack may not be everyone's cup of tea, and that is ok. But I hope the people who do find this interesting will enjoy it once it is ready.
